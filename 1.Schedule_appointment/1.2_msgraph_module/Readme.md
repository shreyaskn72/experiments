# Microsoft Bookings Appointment Scheduler

This Python script allows you to schedule appointments in Microsoft Bookings using the Microsoft Graph API and the `msgraph` module.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to have the following:

1. **Azure Active Directory Application**: Register your application in the Azure Active Directory and note down the client ID and client secret.

2. **Microsoft Graph API Permissions**: Assign the necessary permissions to your application to interact with the Microsoft Bookings API.

3. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

4. **Required Libraries**: Install the `msgraph` module using the following command:
```
pip install msgraph
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the Python script.

2. Open the script `schedule_appointment_msgraph.py` in a text editor.

3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual values:
- `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`: Replace with your Azure Active Directory Application client ID.
- `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`: Replace with your Azure Active Directory Application client secret.
- `YOUR_TENANT_ID`: Replace with your Azure Active Directory tenant ID.
- `YOUR_BUSINESS_ID`: Replace with the Business ID you want to schedule the appointment for.
